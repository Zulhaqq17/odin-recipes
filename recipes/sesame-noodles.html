        <h1>Garlic Sesame Noodles</h1>
        <img src="../images/garlic-sesame-noodles.jpeg" alt="Noodles">
        <p>This Asian noodle dish is saucy, garlicky, and just a little spicy. You can control the spiciness by the amount of chili flakes you use. Feel free to add some veggies or top with a fried egg for an even heartier meal. This may be served hot or cold, but we prefer ours hot.</p>
        
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>

            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper chili flakes, or to taste</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder</li>

            <li>1 green onion, white part only, finely chopped</li>
            <li>5 ounces dry wheat noodles</li>

           <li>1 teaspoon black sesame seeds</li>

           <li>3 tablespoons neutral vegetable oil (see Cook's Note)</li>

           <li>1 tablespoon sliced green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir soy sauce, garlic, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, chili flakes, brown sugar, chicken bouillon powder, and white part of the green onion in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes or according to package directions. Drain well and leave noodles in the pot. Pour the chili-garlic sauce over the noodles, and mix well.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a small dry skillet over medium heat. Add sesame seeds and toast until seeds are fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. When really hot, carefully pour over the noodle mixture, and toss until all noodles are evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. To serve, divide noodles between two bowls, and garnish with green onion slices and toasted sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
